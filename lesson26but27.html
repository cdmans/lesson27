            <h2>Early Game Towers</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Gladiator, the best early game tower for speedrunning and usable as a crowd control tower.</li>
            <li>Golden Scout, very good cost efficiency, spammable and cheap.</li>
            <li>Ace Pilot, very good cost efficiency and does high dps, only downside is that its inconsistent.</li>
            <li>Cowboy/Golden Cowboy, both are good dps options while also giving you lots of cash.</li>
            <li>Golden Crook Boss, pretty good cost efficiency and good dps, only downside is placement limit.</li>
            <li>Golden Pyro, shreds early crowds and deals with Hardcore mode's early game easily.</li>
            <li>Golden Soldier, decent option for early defense, however outclassed by almost everything above.</li>
            <li>Shotgunner, decent for Molten mode early game while struggling in Fallen mode without other towers.</li>
            <li>Engineer, decent although slow early game until you can get level 3.</li>
             </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="midgame">
            <h2>Midgame Towers</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Golden Scout, decent option for Midgame defense while you get other towers.</li>
                <li>Golden Crook Boss, same as Golden Scout.</li>
                <li>Golden Minigunner, level 3 has good cost efficiency and range. Scales decently into Lategame.</li>
                <li>Accelerator, level 5 will shred anything while you prepare more defenses or work on more economy.</li>
                <li>Golden Cowboy, will make a ridiculous amount of money while dealing good dps, snowballs really fast.</li>
                <li>Minigunner, also deals good dps for the price at level 3.</li>
                <li>Engineer, level 4 spam can handle most enemies.</li>
                <li>Ace Pilot, can deal good inconsistent dps and handles most enemies well.</li>
                <li>Commander, level 2 is extremely cheap for what it does. (45% constant firerate buff if you get 3 commanders to level 2)</li>
                <li>DJ, the range buff is helpful while the 10% discount at level 3 saves a good amount of money.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lategame">
            <h2>Late Game Towers</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Accelerator, massive dps with commander, it is the single best dps tower in the game.</li>
            <li>Engineer, deals lots of dps for a decent price, the only issue is the Sentry range.</li>
            <li>Commander, a constant 55% firerate buff is massive and is why Accel > Engi</li>
            <li>DJ, range buff is very helpful and the discount saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Medic, this is where medic becomes useful, her ability is very good however her dps is not very good.</li>
            <li>Golden Minigunner, deals good sub dps, helpful to spam when you reach your limit of Accelerators or Engineers.</li>
            <li>Golden Pyro, deals good aoe damage while reducing defense which becomes common in the Lategame of Hardcore, PW2, Badlands 2 and Fallen.</li>
            <li>Minigunner, if you don't have any of the high dps towers above, Minigunner is a viable option for dps.</li>
            <li>Turret, while having poor cost efficiency, is a good option for newer players to Hardcore, Badlands 2 and PW2.</li>
            <li>Golden Cowboy, snowballs heavily in the Lategame and deals decent dps as well. It can allow you to max out all of the most expensive towers in the game before the final wave.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="dontbuy">
            <h2>Towers You Should Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Ranger, very poor dps for the cost, and the range doesn't make up for that. No, giving it HD won't fix it.</li>
            <li>Soldier, eliminates any possibility of bad RNG and guarantees you get an A or S tier tower.</li>
            <li>Electroshocker, while it stuns decently it does barely any damage along with poor range and a placement limit of 4.</li>
            <li>Freezer, mediocre stun time with 2 dps. 2. dps. It also has poor range and not much firerate in early levels.</li>
            <li>Hunter, its literally worse than sniper in every way. Don't buy!</li>
            <li>Paintballer, while its decent for the first few waves, it falls off after any Early Game boss.</li>
            <li>Demoman, not very useful at any stage of the game. Low dps and range while being somewhat expensive makes this tower very mid.</li>
            <li>Rocketeer, this tower is complete garbage. It has 8 dps for 12k. The dps is lower than Scout and paintballer's. NEVER buy this until it is reworked or buffed.</li>
            <li>Pyromancer, don't buy this until you begin grinding for Golden Crates.</li>
            <li>All of the level tower gamepasses, grinding will simply be easier and free. You will get all the level towers for free if you play the game enough.</li>
            </ul>
